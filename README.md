# VolleyTools
Volleytools is an score board app made for volleyball lovers like me. As a passionate volleyball player ever since high school, on the court is where I feel the comfortable and free. It is named "VolleyTools" because I want this to be a collection of all the tools that could be used for volleyball, starting with a digitial scoreboard.

Playing post secondary volleyball was a dream of mine back in the high school days. Although the dream stay as a dream for now, I still love this sport to death.To contribute to the volleyball community, I made a app that helps people keep score of a on going game. After logging in with a google account, user can also save/delete match history details for future!
<br/>
<br/>
For the future, I plan on adding the feature of auto generating a scoresheet of a game as a PDF. Back in the highschool league games, we'd always have to send people to do the [scoresheet](https://volleyball.ca/uploads/Development/Referee/Rules/Volleyball_Canada_Score_Sheet_Presentation_v3_4_-_Sept_2016.pdf) and it was not particularly easy to do. Having a tool like this would definitely help save some time and energy.
