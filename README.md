Volleytools is an score board app made for volleyball lovers like me. As a passionate volleyball player ever since high school, on the court is where I feel the comfortable and free. 

Playing post secondary volleyball was a dream of mine back in the high school days. Although the dream stayed as a dream, I still love this sport to death.

To contribute to the volleyball community, I made a app that helps people keep score of a on going game. After logging in with a google account, user can also save/delete match history details for future!

VolleyTools supports:
- Basic functionality of a scoreboard app
- Log in system with Google
- Saving/delete data to and from a JSON tree that is related to your Google account

Some new things Iâ€™ve learned:
